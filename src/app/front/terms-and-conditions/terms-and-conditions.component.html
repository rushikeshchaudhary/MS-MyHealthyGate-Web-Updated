    <h3>Tele-Medicine</h3>
    <p>Some of our Services may include a tele-health online solution that allows participating medical professionals and health care staff (“Providers”) to communicate with their clients, customers and/or patients (collectively, “Patients”) to provide health care related services online and perform virtual house calls via Internet connection. We are not responsible for internet connectivity or lack thereof or problems or issues related to the use thereof. We are not a medical service provider, health insurance company, nor licensed to sell health insurance. The Services are not intended for use by Providers and/or Patients in connection with active patient monitoring so as to allow immediate clinical action or continuous monitoring.</p>
    <p>The Providers who deliver services through our Service are independent professionals practicing within a group of independently owned professional practices. We do not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and do not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Providers, each of whom is responsible for his, her or their services and compliance with the requirements applicable to his/her/their profession and license.</p>
    <p>Information provided by Providers and/or Patients is merely transmitted via the Services, not verified or endorsed by us, and is provided on an “as-is” basis and we disclaim all warranties, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for particular purpose. We shall in no event be liable to you or to anyone for any decision made or action taken by any party (including, without limitation, any Service user) in reliance on information about Providers or Patients on the Service.<p>
    <p>If you reside outside Jordan, we are not reliable or responsible or affiliated with any insurance or Medicare beneficiaries unless listed by MHG. A health care provider’s ability to use our services is not an endorsement or recommendation of that health care provider by us. Neither we nor any third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to the Services shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a Provider via the Services. The medical advice provided by your Provider is not under our control, nor is it provided to you by us. If you are a Patient, you accept responsibility for yourself in the use of the Services. You acknowledge that your relationship for health care services is with your health care provider, and your obtaining services from the Provider is solely at your own risk and you assume full responsibility for all risk associated therewith, to the extent permitted by law. By using the Service, you agree to not hold us liable in any way for any malpractice or substandard treatment the Provider may render.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to confirm certain credentials of Providers using our Services, such as validating that they are in good standing with their respective licensure board(s). The Providers utilizing or featured on the Service are independent practitioners practicing on their own behalf, not our employees. Any opinions, advice, or information expressed by a health care facility, professional or specialist or other Provider using or featured on the Service are of the facility, professional, specialist or other Provider alone. They do not reflect our opinions.</p>
    <p>We do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, Providers, products, procedures, medications, devices, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Service or by a Provider or licensee of ours. We do not make any representations or warranties about the training or skill of any Providers who provide services via the Service. You will be provided with a list of available providers in different locations based solely on the information you provide to us. You are ultimately responsible for choosing your particular Provider. The inclusion of Providers on the Service or in any professional directory located on the Service does not imply recommendation or endorsement of such Provider nor is such information intended as a tool for verifying the credentials, qualifications, or abilities of any Provider contained therein.</p>
    <p>To the extent medical advice is provided to you by a Provider through the Services, such medical advice is based on your personal health data as provided by you to the Provider and the local standards of care for your presenting symptoms, based on the information you provide.</p>
    <p>Patients may be required to provide certain Personal Information, including name, date of birth, gender, address, email, mobile and work phone, as well as a user id and password. Patients may also provide certain optional information, including middle name or initial, home phone and other contact info, pharmacy name and contact details, picture and communications preferences. In addition, the Patient can communicate other health-related information to the Provider during a video consultation via the Services. Patient medication history is a list of prescriptions that healthcare providers have prescribed for you. A variety of sources, including pharmacies and health insurers, contribute to the collection of this history. By using the Services, you give your permission to allow your particular Provider to obtain your medication history, specifically for use in providing care. Optional information is not required to register for an account but may be helpful to us in providing you with a more customized experience when using the Site or its Services.</p>
    <p>The use of the Service by any entity or individual to verify the credentials of Providers is prohibited.</p>
    <p><b>INFORMED CONSENT & RISKS.</b> As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine or any other Services.
